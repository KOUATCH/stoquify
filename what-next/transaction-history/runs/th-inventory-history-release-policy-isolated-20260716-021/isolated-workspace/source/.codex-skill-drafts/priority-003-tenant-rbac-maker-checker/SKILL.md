# Tenant RBAC Maker Checker

## Purpose

Harden tenant scope, RBAC, and maker-checker controls across protected service and action boundaries.

## When To Use

Use this skill when:

- this is the next eligible item in the ordered AqStoqFlow priority remediation suite;
- the user asks to continue, implement, remediate, harden, validate, or report on this specific priority;
- all dependent lower-numbered priority skills are complete, not applicable, or explicitly blocked with evidence.

Do not use this skill when:

- a lower-numbered priority skill has an unresolved dependency that this work needs;
- the requested change would bypass service ownership, tenant isolation, RBAC, audit evidence, fiscal-period controls, or OHADA accounting discipline;
- the user only wants a high-level plan and not implementation, except safe readiness/report mode.

Read only the relevant sections and files after the initial source reports. Prefer current code over stale report assumptions when they conflict.

## Priority Being Solved

Priority ordering rule: tenant isolation and RBAC weaknesses must be closed before economic domain migrations are trusted.

Risk: Legacy actions and routes can accept caller-supplied organization scope or permit approval/posting without proven actor segregation.

Dependencies: priority-001-green-baseline-ratchets and priority-002-service-boundary-ratchets.

## Required Architecture

Use the statutory service pattern:

```text
services/<domain>/*.schemas.ts
services/<domain>/*.errors.ts
services/<domain>/*.service.ts
services/<domain>/__tests__/*.test.ts

actions/<domain>/*.actions.ts     -> thin validation/orchestration only
hooks/<domain>/*.ts               -> data fetching/cache only
components/...                    -> UI only
```

Protected business truth must never be owned directly by server actions, App Router pages, route handlers, hooks, UI components, mock/demo helpers, or direct Prisma calls outside approved services.

## Files And Patterns To Inspect

- services/_shared/protect.ts
- services/_shared/rbac.ts
- services/_shared/tenant.ts
- actions/**/*
- app/api/**/*
- services/**/__tests__/*

## Edit Boundary

May edit:

- services/_shared/*
- actions and routes that derive tenant scope incorrectly
- service tests proving wrong-tenant and unauthorized rejection
- what-next/* tenant/RBAC reports

Must not edit:

- unrelated domains or UI surfaces;
- generated files unless the project command generates them as part of the verified change;
- historical evidence records through destructive changes;
- statutory or legal certification claims without real authority-adapter, country-pack, and expert-review prerequisites.

## Implementation Workflow

1. Inventory protected actions and service calls that accept organizationId or actor fields from request payloads.
2. Ensure trusted context derives organization and actor before handler execution.
3. Add or extend tenant guard helpers without breaking explicit, reviewed multi-tenant administration paths.
4. Enforce separate create, approve, reject, post, export, and certify permissions where the domain needs them.
5. Block same-actor approval unless an existing explicit policy allows it and is documented.
6. Map failures to typed safe errors and add regression tests.

## Security And Compliance Controls

- derive tenant and actor from trusted auth context, never caller-supplied organization scope
- enforce RBAC permissions at the service boundary and keep actions as validation/orchestration only
- enforce maker-checker segregation for approval, posting, certification, and destructive workflows where applicable
- reject closed or locked fiscal periods before economic mutation or certification state change
- record immutable audit and business-event evidence for economic, compliance, and trust decisions
- post valid ledger entries or create explicit close blockers with accountant-review evidence
- return typed, user-safe enterprise errors and keep internal details out of client responses
- add focused regression tests before deleting or ratcheting legacy paths

## Legacy Migration Rules

- Build or confirm the service-owned replacement first.
- Move every caller to the service-backed action or route.
- Add regression tests proving the old behavior still works through the new path.
- Add or update a static/boundary gate so the legacy pattern cannot return.
- Delete old files/functions only after usage reaches zero.
- Preserve behavior unless it conflicts with tenant safety, RBAC, auditability, fiscal periods, ledger integrity, maker-checker controls, or OHADA accounting discipline.

## Regression Test Requirements

- wrong-tenant rejection
- unauthorized actor rejection
- same-maker approval rejection where applicable
- safe action result mapping

## Static And Boundary Gate Requirements

- Run the relevant domain gate before and after migration.
- Update report-mode findings with exact file paths, classifications, and replacement service owners.
- Move a gate from report mode to fail mode only when active findings for that class reach zero or have explicit expiring allowlist entries.
- Keep `npm run inventory:boundary:fail` green when touching inventory or stock producers.
- Keep `node scripts/service-boundary-gate.js --mode report` current when touching actions, app routes, hooks, or components.

## Verification Commands

```powershell
npm test -- services/_shared --runInBand
npm test -- actions --runInBand
npm run typecheck
node scripts/service-boundary-gate.js --mode report
```

## Completion Report Format

Save a report under `what-next/` named `AQSTOQFLOW_PRIORITY_003_TENANT_RBAC_MAKER_CHECKER_REPORT_2026-06-16.md` containing:

- priority skill name and number;
- source reports and files inspected;
- current priority status before changes;
- files changed;
- services added or reused;
- actions, routes, hooks, or UI callers migrated;
- security, tenant, RBAC, maker-checker, audit, business-event, ledger, and close-blocker controls added;
- tests added or changed;
- static/boundary gates run;
- verification commands and results;
- remaining blockers and the next priority skill to run.

## Stop Conditions And Blocker Reporting

Stop and save a blocker report when:

- required schema or service ownership cannot be determined from current code;
- a migration would require deleting evidence-bearing data without an approved replacement path;
- a statutory, payroll, tax, or legal claim would require expert approval not present in the repo;
- a lower-numbered priority dependency is still open and this skill would build on unstable ground;
- verification reveals unrelated failures that make the touched-slice result impossible to isolate.

## Success Criteria

Tenant, actor, permission, and maker-checker rules are enforced centrally and proven on representative legacy and modern paths.
