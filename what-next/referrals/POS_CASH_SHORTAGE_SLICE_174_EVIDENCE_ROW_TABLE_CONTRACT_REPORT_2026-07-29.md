# POS Cash Shortage Slice 174 Evidence-Row Table Contract Report

Date: 2026-07-29

## Scope

Certified Phase 3 / Slice 174 as a read-only one-row table over the Slice 173 POS cash-shortage production activation review evidence-row contract.

## Implementation

- Added a derived one-row table type and helper in `services/leakage/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.ts`.
- The helper reads the certified Slice 173 evidence row, returns `rowCount: 1`, stores the row in `rows`, and preserves `activationAuthorized: false`.
- Added blocked, ready, and partial focused tests in `services/leakage/__tests__/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.test.ts`.

## Guardrail Result

No runtime authority was added. The slice does not introduce detector execution, scheduler behavior, route/action surfaces, database or Prisma writes, migrations, alerts, rollback execution, browser/UI behavior, AI authority, WhatsApp authority, or production activation.

## Verification

- `npm test -- --runInBand services/leakage/__tests__/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.test.ts`
  - Passed: 1 suite, 303 tests.
- `npm test -- --runInBand services/leakage/__tests__/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.test.ts services/leakage/__tests__/pos-cash-shortage-production-policy-readiness-preflight.test.ts services/leakage/__tests__/pos-cash-shortage-scheduler-policy-preflight.test.ts services/leakage/__tests__/pos-cash-shortage-resolution-readiness-preflight.test.ts`
  - Passed: 4 suites, 373 tests.
- `npm run typecheck`
  - Passed.
- `npx eslint services/leakage/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.ts services/leakage/__tests__/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.test.ts`
  - Passed.
- `rg -n "CHECK_RUNNERS|scheduleWorkflow|cron|router|createSafeAction|recordWorkflowAssuranceIncident|transitionWorkflowAssuranceIncident|db\.|prisma|migrate|migration|activationAuthorized: true|WhatsApp|copilot|AI" services\leakage\pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.ts`
  - No matches.

## Residual Risk

Slice 174 remains a contract-only read model layer. Production activation is still blocked until service-owned runtime evidence, real auth, release gates, audit controls, browser certification, rollback readiness, and owner/security approval are separately certified.

## Filename Note

The fully descriptive artifact name would exceed Windows' per-filename length limit, so this report uses a shorter canonical Slice 174 filename while preserving the full selected slice name inside the status register and selection report.

## Next Handoff

Return to `stoquify-referral-war-room-orchestrator` for post-Slice 174 review and Slice 175 selection.
