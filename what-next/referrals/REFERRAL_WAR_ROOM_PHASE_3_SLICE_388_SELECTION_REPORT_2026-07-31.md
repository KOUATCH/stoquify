Leakage guardrail: `stoquify-cash-leakage-radar`

## Selection

Slice 388 is selected to add a compact read-only evidence comment derived from the certified Slice 387 production activation evidence annotation.

## Scope

- Add a service-owned `PosCashShortageProductionActivationSlice388EvidenceComment` wrapper.
- Preserve the Slice 387 annotation as source evidence.
- Add focused blocked, ready, and partial tests.
- Keep production activation unauthorized with `activationAuthorized: false`.

## Non-Authority

This slice does not add or authorize any route, action, UI, worker, scheduler, detector, DB or Prisma write, migration, browser automation, alert, rollback, AI, copilot, WhatsApp, or production activation authority.

## Expected Verification

- Source authority scan with no matches.
- Focused Jest for `pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.test.ts`.
- Related leakage preflight Jest bundle.
- `npm run typecheck`.
- Scoped ESLint for the touched source and test files.
- Whitespace and status-register hygiene checks.
