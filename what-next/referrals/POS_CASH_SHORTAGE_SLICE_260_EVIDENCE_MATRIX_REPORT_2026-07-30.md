# POS Cash Shortage Slice 260 Evidence Matrix Report

Date: 2026-07-30

## Result

Slice 260 is certified. The POS cash-shortage production activation preflight now exposes a read-only evidence matrix derived from the certified Slice 259 evidence chart.

## Before

- Slice 259 was certified as the active handoff.
- No Slice 260 helper or focused tests existed.
- Production activation remained blocked and unauthorized.

## After

- `services/leakage/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.ts` exports `PosCashShortageProductionActivationSlice260EvidenceMatrix` at line 6037.
- `services/leakage/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.ts` exports `buildPosCashShortageProductionActivationSlice260EvidenceMatrix` at line 6048.
- Focused tests cover blocked, ready, and partial matrix evidence states at lines 15746, 15780, and 15825.

## Guardrails Preserved

- `activationAuthorized` remains `false` in the new helper.
- No detector, scheduler, worker, DB/Prisma write, migration, route/action, UI, browser automation, alert, rollback, AI, copilot, WhatsApp, or production activation authority was added.
- The matrix derives only from service-owned production activation preflight evidence.

## Verification

- `npm test -- --runInBand services/leakage/__tests__/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.test.ts` passed: 1 suite, 561 tests.

- `npm run typecheck` passed.
- `npx eslint services/leakage/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.ts services/leakage/__tests__/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.test.ts` passed.
- Authority scan on `services/leakage/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.ts` returned no matches.
