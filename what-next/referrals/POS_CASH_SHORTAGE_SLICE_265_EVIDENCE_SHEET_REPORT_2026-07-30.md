# POS Cash Shortage Slice 265 Evidence Sheet Report

Date: 2026-07-30

## Result

Slice 265 is certified. The POS cash-shortage production activation preflight now exposes a read-only evidence sheet derived from the certified Slice 264 evidence frame.

## Before

- Slice 264 was certified as the active handoff.
- No Slice 265 helper or focused tests existed.
- Production activation remained blocked and unauthorized.

## After

- `services/leakage/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.ts` exports `PosCashShortageProductionActivationSlice265EvidenceSheet` at line 6207.
- `services/leakage/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.ts` exports `buildPosCashShortageProductionActivationSlice265EvidenceSheet` at line 6218.
- Focused tests cover blocked, ready, and partial sheet evidence states at lines 16296, 16335, and 16385.

## Guardrails Preserved

- `activationAuthorized` remains `false` in the new helper.
- No detector, scheduler, worker, DB/Prisma write, migration, route/action, UI, browser automation, alert, rollback, AI, copilot, WhatsApp, or production activation authority was added.
- The sheet derives only from service-owned production activation preflight evidence.

## Verification

- `npm test -- --runInBand services/leakage/__tests__/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.test.ts` passed: 1 suite, 576 tests.
