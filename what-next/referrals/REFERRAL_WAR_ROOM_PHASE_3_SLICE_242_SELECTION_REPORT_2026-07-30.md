# Referral War Room Phase 3 Slice 242 Selection Report

Date: 2026-07-30

## Selection

Slice 242 is selected as a narrow POS cash shortage production activation evidence summary contract over the certified Slice 241 evidence row.

## Evidence

- Slice 241 is certified in `what-next/referrals/REFERRAL_WAR_ROOM_STATUS.md`.
- `services/leakage/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.ts` has no joined helper boundary and preserves `activationAuthorized: false`.
- `services/leakage/__tests__/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.test.ts` has the Slice 241 blocked, ready, and partial evidence-row tests.

## Scope

- Add one read-only summary helper in `services/leakage/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.ts`.
- Add focused blocked, ready, and partial tests in `services/leakage/__tests__/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.test.ts`.
- Preserve service-owned evidence and avoid runtime authority.

## Non-Goals

- No route, action, scheduler, worker, migration, database write, UI, AI, WhatsApp, production activation, or rollback behavior.
- No change to detector thresholds, workflow state, tenant access, RBAC, redaction, or audit semantics.

## Verification Plan

- `npm test -- --runInBand services/leakage/__tests__/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.test.ts`
- `npm test -- --runInBand services/leakage/__tests__/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.test.ts services/leakage/__tests__/pos-cash-shortage-production-policy-readiness-preflight.test.ts services/leakage/__tests__/pos-cash-shortage-scheduler-policy-preflight.test.ts services/leakage/__tests__/pos-cash-shortage-resolution-readiness-preflight.test.ts`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npx eslint services/leakage/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.ts services/leakage/__tests__/pos-cash-shortage-production-activation-preflight.test.ts`
- Authority scan for runtime enablement terms.
