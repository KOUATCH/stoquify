Use when executing the ordered priority remediation suite, hardening this codebase priority, migrating legacy code into service-owned workflows, adding OHADA controls, or validating this release gate."

# Demo Report Trust Cleaner

## Purpose

Remove production-visible mock/demo paths and make reports display real provenance, freshness, and certification state.

## When To Use

Use this skill when:

- this is the next eligible item in the ordered AqStoqFlow priority remediation suite;
- the user asks to continue, implement, remediate, harden, validate, or report on this specific priority;
- all dependent lower-numbered priority skills are complete, not applicable, or explicitly blocked with evidence.

Do not use this skill when:

- a lower-numbered priority skill has an unresolved dependency that this work needs;
- the requested change would bypass service ownership, tenant isolation, RBAC, audit evidence, fiscal-period controls, or OHADA accounting discipline;
- the user only wants a high-level plan and not implementation, except safe readiness/report mode.

## Source Reports To Read

- what-next/AQSTOQFLOW_STATUTORY_SERVICE_MODERNIZATION_SCAN_2026-06-16.md

- graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md

Read only the relevant sections and files after the initial source reports. Prefer current code over stale report assumptions when they conflict.

## Priority Being Solved

Priority 5 and Slice 6 from the examination report.

Risk: Mock inventory, monitoring, and report placeholders can make dashboards and reports appear more operationally trustworthy than their evidence supports.

Dependencies: priority-001 through priority-007.

## Required Architecture

Use the statutory service pattern:

```text
services/<domain>/*.schemas.ts
services/<domain>/*.errors.ts
services/<domain>/*.service.ts
services/<domain>/__tests__/*.test.ts

actions/<domain>/*.actions.ts     -> thin validation/orchestration only
hooks/<domain>/*.ts               -> data fetching/cache only
components/...                    -> UI only
```

Protected business truth must never be owned directly by server actions, App Router pages, route handlers, hooks, UI components, mock/demo helpers, or direct Prisma calls outside approved services.

## Files And Patterns To Inspect

- actions/inventory/inventoryActions.ts
- app/[locale]/(dashboard)/dashboard/items/new/page.tsx
- components/reports/cash-flow-report.tsx
- lib/error-handling/monitoring.ts
- app/**/*report*
- actions/**/*report*
- components/**/*report*

## Edit Boundary

May edit:

- demo/mock actions only to quarantine or replace with service-backed code
- report actions/components to add provenance and freshness metadata
- monitoring helpers to return explicit not-configured states
- tests for no mock production data and report provenance

Must not edit:

- unrelated domains or UI surfaces;
- generated files unless the project command generates them as part of the verified change;
- historical evidence records through destructive changes;
- statutory or legal certification claims without real authority-adapter, country-pack, and expert-review prerequisites.

## Implementation Workflow

1. Search production paths for mock, demo, TODO, placeholder, fake metrics, and report trust language.
2. Move true demo examples behind explicit demo-only namespaces that cannot be imported by production routes.
3. Replace production mock data with service-backed reads or explicit not-configured responses.
4. Add report provenance fields: source, period, generatedAt, freshness, certification/internal evidence status, and known blockers.
5. Add a no-mock-production-data gate or extend an existing scanner.
6. Save a cleanup report with remaining intentional demo-only files.

## Security And Compliance Controls

- derive tenant and actor from trusted auth context, never caller-supplied organization scope
- enforce RBAC permissions at the service boundary and keep actions as validation/orchestration only
- enforce maker-checker segregation for approval, posting, certification, and destructive workflows where applicable
- reject closed or locked fiscal periods before economic mutation or certification state change
- record immutable audit and business-event evidence for economic, compliance, and trust decisions
- post valid ledger entries or create explicit close blockers with accountant-review evidence
- return typed, user-safe enterprise errors and keep internal details out of client responses
- add focused regression tests before deleting or ratcheting legacy paths

## Legacy Migration Rules

- Build or confirm the service-owned replacement first.
- Move every caller to the service-backed action or route.
- Add regression tests proving the old behavior still works through the new path.
- Add or update a static/boundary gate so the legacy pattern cannot return.
- Delete old files/functions only after usage reaches zero.
- Preserve behavior unless it conflicts with tenant safety, RBAC, auditability, fiscal periods, ledger integrity, maker-checker controls, or OHADA accounting discipline.

## Regression Test Requirements

- production route/action does not return mock business data
- report component/action exposes provenance and freshness
- scanner catches representative mock production import

## Static And Boundary Gate Requirements

- Run the relevant domain gate before and after migration.
- Update report-mode findings with exact file paths, classifications, and replacement service owners.
- Move a gate from report mode to fail mode only when active findings for that class reach zero or have explicit expiring allowlist entries.
- Keep `npm run inventory:boundary:fail` green when touching inventory or stock producers.
- Keep `node scripts/service-boundary-gate.js --mode report` current when touching actions, app routes, hooks, or components.

## Verification Commands

```powershell
rg -n "Mock implementation|mockItems|mockTransactions|mockAdjustments|mockTransfers|demo route|TODO: Update the import path" actions app components lib services
npm test -- actions components services --runInBand
npm run typecheck
```

## Completion Report Format

Save a report under `what-next/` named `AQSTOQFLOW_PRIORITY_008_DEMO_REPORT_TRUST_CLEANER_REPORT_2026-06-16.md` containing:

- priority skill name and number;
- source reports and files inspected;
- current priority status before changes;
- files changed;
- services added or reused;
- actions, routes, hooks, or UI callers migrated;
- security, tenant, RBAC, maker-checker, audit, business-event, ledger, and close-blocker controls added;
- tests added or changed;
- static/boundary gates run;
- verification commands and results;
- remaining blockers and the next priority skill to run.

## Stop Conditions And Blocker Reporting

Stop and save a blocker report when:

- required schema or service ownership cannot be determined from current code;
- a migration would require deleting evidence-bearing data without an approved replacement path;
- a statutory, payroll, tax, or legal claim would require expert approval not present in the repo;
- a lower-numbered priority dependency is still open and this skill would build on unstable ground;
- verification reveals unrelated failures that make the touched-slice result impossible to isolate.

## Success Criteria

No production route or action exports mock stock, finance, payment, payroll, compliance, or report-trust data.
